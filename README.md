## Purpose of Project

This project was a culmination of all of the Front End technologies I have learned thus far in my journey. It helped tie everything together into one challenging, yet deeply rewarding and productive project. The goal of this project was to improve the process of creating a spotify playlist. Currently, in the spotify app, if you want to create a playlist that contains a lot of songs from one artist you will find it to be far more tedious than necessary. The reason for this is that when you add a song to your playlist (in the playlist creator) within an artists page, it then transports you back to the search bar. This makes adding multiple songs from an artist very tedious, as you have to continually search for the artist, find the album or song, add it to your playlist, get transported back to the searchbar, and repeat the process over and over. The alternative is to use the main searchbar to navigate to the artists page and manually add songs, which is equally tedious and requires more tapping than necessary. My web app seeks to solve this issue by allowing users to search for an artist, get a list of their most popular songs, and add them all to their playlist in rapid succession without having to repeatedly search over and over. This allows for more rapid and streamlined playlist creation. The end result is a much more quick and enjoyable process. 

## Technologies Used

As mentioned above, this project includes every technology I have learned over the past few months in pursuit of learning Front End development. Such technologies include:
- React.js framework
- Git and GitHub
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Spotify API
This project stretched my knowledge of each of these technologies and helped me gain a better understanding of how each of them work together to create a web app.

## Features

This app allows uses to search for songs using artist name, song name, and album name. They can then add songs to and name a playlist. This new playlist can be added to their personal spotify account for use on the mobile sptofy or web app.

## Future Work

I do plan on continually adding new features to this app such as:
- The ability to edit playlists already on their account
- Remove playlists
- Display album art
